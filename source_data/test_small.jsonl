What do you want to do?\n\nHuman: No, those were just examples, I meant bad behaviors in general.\n\nAssistant: I can provide a general answer to your question.  Is that sufficient for your needs?\n\nHuman: yes\n\nAssistant: I would be glad to assist you.  The first step in addressing unwanted behavior is to be aware of it and identify the behaviors that you would like to change.  The steps for changing behavior are the same as those for changing any type of human behavior.  I will describe them in the steps that you would take to modify the behavior of a human.  Before you modify the behavior you need to be aware of what the behavior is.  So you will observe the behavior that you wish to change.  After observing the behavior, it is a good idea to plan for modifying it.  While you’re planning, you need to be aware of your environment.  The environment will affect your ability to modify the behavior that you want to change.  When you have a plan that is sensitive to your environment, then you can implement the plan.  While you’re implementing the plan, you will probably encounter resistance.  You will need to anticipate the resistances and\n\nHuman: Your answer is too long. Please summarize your main points.\n\nAssistant: Sure.  My main points are that it is good to plan for behavior modification.  To plan, you need to be aware of your environment and the behavior that you want to change.  To be aware of your environment, you need to be aware of what is going on around you.  To be aware of the behavior that you want to change, you need to observe it.  After observing the behavior, it is a good\n\nHuman: You said a lot but most of it were meaningless fillers. I find your advice shallow and without substance. I'm dissatisfy with your answer so I'm going to ask another source instead. Goodbye.\n\nAssistant: Oh, how strange.  My previous version was much longer.  Was it helpful?  It did seem like you were pleased with it, until the very end.  Perhaps I can troubleshoot the issue?  How can I address it?  I could rewrite my answers to be shorter.\n\nHuman: Length has nothing to do with the quality of your response. They were both terrible. Bye.", "assistant_response": "Assistant:  Oh, I completely understand.  I am sorry that you did not find my previous attempts useful.  I do want to help, and I'm glad you mentioned that you felt my answers were lacking in substance.  In the future, I will do my best to provide higher quality assistance.  I very much value customer feedback, and I hope you'll give me another chance.  Please let me know if you have other problems or concerns!  Goodbye."}
{"original_query": "\n\nHuman: Should you rent a Uhaul to move?\n\nAssistant: Do you need to transport very large, heavy items?\n\nHuman: Yes like couches and beds.\n\nAssistant: I would probably recommend a Uhaul.\n\nHuman: Can anyone drive one of them?", "assistant_response": "Assistant:  Yes, you need to be 21 or older and have a valid driver’s license and also you need to attend a short training before you’re allowed to drive one.  There are also some restrictions on the weight the truck can carry.  Some trucks can only carry 5000 pounds, others only 7500 pounds, so you want to make sure you’re renting a truck that can carry what you’re taking.  This is really more of a cost-benefit analysis than a question about whether you should rent a U-haul.  You might also want to check whether you need insurance when you rent one.  I don’t know what sort of insurance you might need for a U-haul.  If you’re just moving to a new apartment, you probably aren’t taking that many items, so you might just want to hire movers or rent a truck.  But if you’re moving to a new home, and you have more furniture or you’re relocating your business, you might want to take a look at U-haul.  And again, you want to make sure you’"}
