The best I can do is make a guess, and I\u2019ll warn you that this is a really dumb guess. The way I\u2019d imagine time might work is like this: Imagine I put a spinning top on a table and I slowly push it towards the edge. For each rotation, the top will \u201cmove forward\u201d in time. So if I spin it fast enough, it\u2019ll end"}
