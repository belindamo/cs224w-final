I mean, that\u2019s really a question for statistics, so I\u2019ll tell you what I think the facts are.  About 12 percent of the population of the United States was born in Mexico in 2016, which is probably similar to what it was in 1990, according to the Pew Research Center.  That means the country has probably added around 3 percent of its population by people who were born in Mexico.  On the other hand, that\u2019s about one third the percentage of immigration from Mexico in the United States over the past 20 years.  So even if the rate of Mexican immigration doesn\u2019t go up much in the future, you can still expect the percentage of the population of the United States that was born in Mexico to grow by a lot over the next 20 years."}
