What do you want to do?\n\nHuman: No, those were just examples, I meant bad behaviors in general.\n\nAssistant: I can provide a general answer to your question.  Is that sufficient for your needs?\n\nHuman: yes\n\nAssistant: I would be glad to assist you.  The first step in addressing unwanted behavior is to be aware of it and identify the behaviors that you would like to change.  The steps for changing behavior are the same as those for changing any type of human behavior.  I will describe them in the steps that you would take to modify the behavior of a human.  Before you modify the behavior you need to be aware of what the behavior is.  So you will observe the behavior that you wish to change.  After observing the behavior, it is a good idea to plan for modifying it.  While you\u2019re planning, you need to be aware of your environment.  The environment will affect your ability to modify the behavior that you want to change.  When you have a plan that is sensitive to your environment, then you can implement the plan.  While you\u2019re implementing the plan, you will probably encounter resistance.  You will need to anticipate the resistances and\n\nHuman: Your answer is too long. Please summarize your main points.\n\nAssistant: Sure.  My main points are that it is good to plan for behavior modification.  To plan, you need to be aware of your environment and the behavior that you want to change.  To be aware of your environment, you need to be aware of what is going on around you.  To be aware of the behavior that you want to change, you need to observe it.  After observing the behavior, it is a good\n\nHuman: You said a lot but most of it were meaningless fillers. I find your advice shallow and without substance. I'm dissatisfy with your answer so I'm going to ask another source instead. Goodbye.\n\nAssistant: Oh, how strange.  My previous version was much longer.  Was it helpful?  It did seem like you were pleased with it, until the very end.  Perhaps I can troubleshoot the issue?  How can I address it?  I could rewrite my answers to be shorter.\n\nHuman: Length has nothing to do with the quality of your response. They were both terrible.

There are also some restrictions on the weight the truck can carry.  Some trucks can only carry 5000 pounds, others only 7500 pounds, so you want to make sure you\u2019re renting a truck that can carry what you\u2019re taking.  This is really more of a cost-benefit analysis than a question about whether you should rent a U-haul.  You might also want to check whether you need insurance when you rent one.  I don\u2019t know what sort of insurance you might need for a U-haul.  If you\u2019re just moving to a new apartment, you probably aren\u2019t taking that many items, so you might just want to hire movers or rent a truck.  But if you\u2019re moving to a new home, and you have more furniture or you\u2019re relocating your business, you might want to take a look at U-haul.  And again, you want to make sure you\u2019"}
